# SnakesAndLadders
The back-end logic for the classic board game snakes and ladders, I wanted to set my self a challenge and complete this without using any tutorials etc, I wanted to implement things that i have learnt in a Udemy Java course I am currently studying. I built it following the rules of test driven development.
